// Firstly (Write our baseURL in just one file)
// We know about axios so far, but in real projects,
// we have many function that are relevant to backend.
// SO we try to write clean codes which are relevant to API and backend
// So what if for example if our http://localhost:3001 change?
// So we have to change all of them and that'S not good.
// So we can write it here and if we want to change it, we can change just here easily.

// Secondly (Error Handling)
//
import axios from "axios";

axios.defaults.baseURL = "http://localhost:3001";

// You can give your export like that,
// But there is a problem ->
// What if we say we don't want to use axios and we want use another library
// And we must delete export default axios and that's AufwÃ¤ndig
// export default axios -> NO, export default http; -> YES
// So what to do?

const http = {
  get: axios.get,
  put: axios.put,
  delete: axios.delete,
  post: axios.post,
};
// With this const http object, we don't need anymore to write axios in all components
// And this object has different properties abd we can import it in our components
// SO NOW IF ONE DAY WE WANTED TO USE ANOTHER LIBRARY BUT AXIOS, WE DON'T NEED DELETE AXIOS
// AND IT TAKES TIME, SO WE HAVE NOW HTTP AND WITH ANOTHER LIBRARY WE CHANGE JUST OUR AXIOS IN IT
// AND HTTP STAYS HERE ALWAYS

export default http;
